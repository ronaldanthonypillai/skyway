    <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
    <p>At the end of this lesson participants will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Demonstrate DVI with the assistance of an instructor</li>
        <li>Proper setup of mirrors to allow backing</li>
        <li>Practice backing straight, sight-side, and blind-side</li>
        <li>Practice yard driving, observation & scanning</li>
        <li>Understand location of major vehicle components</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>Instructors should have the vehicle ready for the lesson:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The vehicle should have adequate fuel and DEF to complete the lesson.</li>
        <li>All required equipment should be present for the lesson.</li>
        <li>Vehicle free from defects and ready for service.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Materials Required</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Motorcoach Daily Vehicle Inspection Handout</li>
        <li>Motorcoach</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Teaching Notes</h3>
    <h4>Daily Vehicle Inspection (“DVI”):</h4>
    <h4>Instructor</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Demonstrate how to secure the vehicle properly</li>
        <li>Guide participant through full mechanical overview</li>
        <li>Guide participant through demonstrate/defect/describe sequence for selected major/minors</li>
        <li>Guide participants through all exterior inspection</li>
        <li>Guide participants through all the in-cab checks</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Participant</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Should follow along appropriately, and ask questions suitable to the material, particularly anything that couldn’t be shown in the classroom that would be better shown on the vehicle</li>
        <li>Should have general system for following a pre-trip</li>
        <li>Correct backing when and where necessary allow student time to make mistakes and figure out what they are doing wrong without immediately correcting.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Backing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure that the student performs a variety of backing maneuvers.</li>
        <li>Explain that although they can use any technique; straight-line, sight side, blind side is the safest order of operations.</li>
        <li>Allow student the opportunity to make mistakes. Correct when necessary</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <h4>Mechanical Overview</h4>
    <p>This portion is the largest of the day, it should focus more directly on the mechanical elements of the different vehicles.</p>
    <h4>Pre-trip practice/Mechanical overview in yard</h4>
    <p>This element is designed to allow the student to put the earlier learning into practice and to see the different types of equipment and how they can use it functionally. Also, a great opportunity to reinforce things covered in the mechanical overview.</p>
